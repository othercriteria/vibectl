# Memory Feature for vibectl

This PR implements a context-aware memory system that allows vibectl to maintain context between command invocations, enhancing the user experience by providing more personalized and contextual responses.

## Features

- 🧠 Persistent memory context between commands
- 🔄 Automatic memory updates based on command execution
- 🛑 Memory freeze/unfreeze capabilities for control
- 🖋️ Manual memory editing and updating
- 🔍 Memory inspection via CLI
- 📝 Memory integration in LLM prompts
- ⚙️ Memory configuration options

## Implementation

The memory system is implemented through:

1. A dedicated `memory.py` module with core functionality
2. CLI commands for memory management in `cli.py`
3. Prompt integration via `include_memory_in_prompt` function
4. Memory updates after each command execution
5. Configuration-based persistence
6. Memory-related flags in all main commands

## Testing

All memory functionality is fully tested:
- Unit tests for the memory module
- CLI integration tests
- Prompt integration tests
- End-to-end memory flow tests

## Documentation

- README.md updated with memory feature documentation
- Docstrings added to all memory-related functions
- STRUCTURE.md updated to include memory in system architecture

## Future Enhancements

- Selective memory by namespace or context
- Memory visualization and insights
- Memory export/import for sharing context
- Memory search capabilities
- Long-term memory persistence across different terminals/sessions
- Memory organization by clusters and contexts
