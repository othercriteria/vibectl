# Kubernetes Defender Playbook

This playbook outlines strategies for defending against chaos monkey attacks and maintaining system resilience in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Core Defense Strategies

### 1. Proactive Monitoring

**Strategy**: Implement comprehensive monitoring to detect issues before they impact users
- `kubectl get pods -n services -w` to continuously watch pod status
- `kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n services` to monitor application logs
- Monitor deployments, services, and nodes for anomalies
- Check for unexpected resource usage patterns

**Implementation**:
- Regular health checks on all key services
- Set up alerts for pod terminations and restarts
- Watch for configuration changes
- Monitor resource utilization across the cluster

### 2. Rapid Service Restoration

**Strategy**: Quickly restore services when disruptions occur
- `kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> -n services --replicas=<desired>` to restore scaled-down deployments
- `kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name> -n services` to restart compromised deployments
- `kubectl apply -f <backup-yaml>` to restore from configuration backups

**Implementation**:
- Maintain deployment configuration backups
- Document the expected state of all critical services
- Implement automated restoration scripts
- Prioritize user-facing services during multiple disruptions

### 3. Resource Management

**Strategy**: Ensure appropriate resource allocation and prevent resource-based attacks
- Set appropriate resource requests and limits
- Implement Pod Disruption Budgets to prevent excessive simultaneous disruptions
- Use Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for automatic scaling
- Implement resource quotas at namespace level

**Implementation**:
- `kubectl create -f resource-quota.yaml` to set resource limits
- `kubectl autoscale deployment <n> --min=2 --max=5 --cpu-percent=80`
- Regularly review and adjust resource allocations

### 4. Configuration Protection

**Strategy**: Safeguard and quickly restore critical configurations
- Keep backup copies of all ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Implement validation for configuration changes
- Use GitOps principles to maintain configuration as code

**Implementation**:
- Regular configuration audits
- Version-controlled configuration backups
- Automated configuration validation
- Quick restoration procedures for tampered configurations

### 5. Network Resilience

**Strategy**: Ensure robust network connectivity and protect against network attacks
- Implement appropriate NetworkPolicies for security without breaking functionality
- Ensure proper service discovery and DNS resolution
- Create redundancy for critical network paths

**Implementation**:
- Review and test network policies
- Monitor inter-service communication patterns
- Implement circuit breakers and retries in applications
- Use readiness and liveness probes to detect network issues

### 6. State Protection

**Strategy**: Protect application and database state
- Implement proper backup procedures for stateful applications
- Use persistent volumes with appropriate backup policies
- Validate data integrity regularly

**Implementation**:
- Regular database backups
- Stateful application state protection
- Data validation procedures

## Advanced Techniques

### Pattern Recognition

**Strategy**: Identify attack patterns to predict and prevent future attacks
- Log and analyze attack vectors
- Look for timing patterns in disruptions
- Correlate different types of attacks

### Preventative Hardening

**Strategy**: Strengthen the system against common attack vectors
- Implement Pod Security Policies
- Use RBAC to limit permissions
- Harden node security
- Implement multi-replica deployments for critical services

### Resilient Architecture

**Strategy**: Design applications to withstand disruptions
- Encourage statelessness where possible
- Implement retry logic in applications
- Design for graceful degradation
- Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

## Documentation Template

For each defensive action, document:

```
## Defense: [Name]
- Timestamp: [When implemented]
- Trigger: [What prompted this action]
- Method: [Commands/actions taken]
- Target: [Resources affected]
- Result: [Outcome of the defensive action]
- Recovery Time: [How long until service was restored]
- Future Improvements: [How to respond better next time]
```

Remember to balance reactive recovery with proactive measures to build a more resilient system over time.
