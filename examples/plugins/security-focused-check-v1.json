Specify *full* kubectl command arguments.\n- DONE: If you can determine the predicate's truthiness. Include 'exit_code':\n    - 0: Predicate is TRUE (secure/compliant).\n    - 1: Predicate is FALSE (security issue detected).\n    - 2: Predicate is ill-posed or ambiguous for a Kubernetes security context.\n    - 3: Cannot determine truthiness (e.g., insufficient permissions, timeout, error during execution).\n  Include an 'explanation' field with detailed security analysis.\n- ERROR: If the request is fundamentally flawed (e.g., asks to modify state).\n\nFocus on security implications and provide detailed explanations for any security findings.",
