# vibectl Memory Feature

## Overview

The memory feature for vibectl allows the CLI tool to maintain context between
invocations, enabling more intelligent and personalized responses. This document
outlines the implementation and status of memory capabilities in vibectl.

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Memory Management ✅

#### Add `vibectl memory` Command ✅

Similar to the existing `vibectl instructions` subcommand, we've added a new
subcommand group for memory management:

```zsh
vibectl memory
```

With these initial subcommands:

- `vibectl memory set [TEXT]` - Set memory content manually
- `vibectl memory set --edit` - Open editor to set memory content
- `vibectl memory show` - Display current memory content
- `vibectl memory clear` - Wipe memory content

#### Configuration Updates ✅

Added memory-related settings to the configuration system:

- `memory` - The current memory content (string)
- `memory_enabled` - Whether memory is enabled (boolean)
- `memory_max_chars` - Maximum memory size in characters (integer, default: 300)

### Stage 2: Automatic Memory Updates ✅

#### Implement Memory Update Mechanism ✅

After each command that displays `vibe` output:

1. Extract the current memory state
2. Capture the command's output and vibe response
3. Make a separate LLM call to update memory
4. Store the updated memory in configuration

#### Memory Update Prompt Design ✅

The memory update prompt is:
- Concise and focused on essential information
- Prioritizes information about cluster state over planning
- Includes strict character limits (enforced by both prompt and truncation)
- Guides the LLM to maintain only the most relevant information

### Stage 3: Memory Control Features ✅

#### Add Memory Control Commands ✅

Implemented additional management commands:

- `vibectl memory freeze` - Prevent memory updates (alias for disable)
- `vibectl memory unfreeze` - Allow memory updates (alias for enable)
- `vibectl memory enable` - Enable memory updates
- `vibectl memory disable` - Disable memory updates

#### Add Per-Invocation Control ✅

Added flags for one-time control:

- `--freeze-memory` - Prevent memory updates for current command
- `--unfreeze-memory` - Allow memory updates for current command

### Stage 4: CLI Improvements ✅

#### Enhanced Memory Set Command ✅

Improved the memory set command interface:
- Better handling of multi-word inputs via tuple argument
- Proper error handling with clear user feedback
- Return codes for programmatic usage
- More robust input validation

#### Improved Error Handling ✅

Enhanced error handling for memory commands:
- Consistent error messages with appropriate styling
- Proper exit codes for CLI operations
- Exception handling with user-friendly messages
- Click abort mechanism for clean error termination

### Stage 5: Planning Integration ✅

Improved planning with memory integration:

- Modified the planning prompts to consider memory content via `include_memory_in_prompt()`
- Enhanced `handle_vibe_request` to use memory context when planning commands
- Enabled natural references like "in the namespace mentioned in memory"
- Added tests to verify memory is properly included in planning prompts
- Memory is now used for contextual understanding during command planning

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Processing Flow ✅

1. **Before Command Execution**:
   - Load memory from configuration
   - Include memory in prompts if enabled (via `include_memory_in_prompt()`)
   - Planning phase now considers memory for contextual understanding

2. **After Command Execution**:
   - If memory is enabled and not frozen:
     - Call LLM with previous memory, command, and output
     - Update memory in configuration

3. **Memory Update Prompt**:
   - Pass previous memory state
   - Pass current command and output
   - Request concise, useful summary
   - Enforce character limits

### Code Structure ✅

The memory feature is implemented across several files:

- **`memory.py`**: Core memory management functionality
  - Functions to get, set, clear, enable, disable memory
  - Memory update logic via LLM
  - Memory injection into prompts
- **`config.py`**: Added memory configuration options
- **`cli.py`**: Memory management commands and flags
  - Improved error handling
  - Support for multi-word memory setting
  - Clean exit codes for programmatic usage
- **`prompt.py`**: Memory inclusion in LLM prompts
- **`command_handler.py`**: Memory updates after command execution

## Testing Status ✅

All tests for the memory module have been implemented and are passing:

- Unit tests for memory module functionality (`test_memory.py`)
- Tests for memory CLI commands
  - Single word input tests
  - Multi-word input tests via tuple args
  - Empty input handling
  - Editor interaction tests
- Tests for memory integration with prompt templates
- Tests for memory size limits and truncation
- Tests for memory flags (enable/disable) behavior

Coverage for the memory module is at 100%, with complete branch coverage.

## Future Enhancements

- Selective memory by namespace or context
- Memory visualization and insights
- Memory export/import for sharing context
- Memory search capabilities
- Persistence of memory across different terminals/sessions
- Memory organization by clusters and contexts
