  - type: suggest
    message: |
      Rules must have:
      1. YAML frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply)
      2. Located in .cursor/rules/ directory
      3. Use kebab-case filenames with .mdc extension
      4. Avoid project-specific references for reusability
      5. Use generic patterns that work across different codebases

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Missing YAML frontmatter or wrong location
      # Good: Complete rule file in correct location
