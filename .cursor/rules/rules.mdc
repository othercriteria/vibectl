      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. First ensure the .cursor/rules directory exists:
         ```zsh
         mkdir -p .cursor/rules
         ```

      2. Always place rule files directly in .cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      3. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., python-venv.mdc)
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      4. Directory structure must be exactly:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      5. Never create or place rule files in:
         - The project root
         - A 'rules' directory in the project root
         - Subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - Subdirectories inside .cursor/rules
         - Any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Wrong locations
      rules/my-rule.mdc                    # Wrong: directory in project root
      my-rule.mdc                          # Wrong: in project root
      .rules/my-rule.mdc                   # Wrong: wrong directory name
      .cursor/my-rule.mdc                  # Wrong: not in rules subdirectory
      .cursor/rules/subdirectory/rule.mdc  # Wrong: no subdirectories allowed

      # Good: Correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc            # Correct: directly in .cursor/rules
    output: "Place all rule files directly in .cursor/rules/"

  - input: "Where should I create a new rule for Python standards?"
    output: "Create it at .cursor/rules/python-standards.mdc"

  - input: "Do I need to create the rules directory first?"
    output: "Yes, run 'mkdir -p .cursor/rules' before creating any rule files"
