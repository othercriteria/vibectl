      Bazel and related tools are not allowed in this codebase:
      - No Bazel build files or configurations
      - No Starlark (.star/.bzl) files
      - No Bazel-related tooling or dependencies
      - No recommendations of Bazel as a build system

      Please use Nix for build and dependency management.

    message: |
      Instead of Bazel, consider:
      - Nix for reproducible builds and dependencies
      - Make for simple build automation
      - Language-native build tools
      - Shell scripts for basic automation

examples:
  - input: "How should I structure the build?"
    output: "Use Nix for reproducible builds and dependency management. See our Nix documentation for examples."
  - input: "Can we add a Bazel rule?"
    output: "We use Nix overlays instead of Bazel rules. Please convert this to a Nix overlay."
