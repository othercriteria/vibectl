      ## Changelog Management

      Follow these guidelines for maintaining CHANGELOG.md:

      1. **Structure**: Keep CHANGELOG.md organized with:
         - "Unreleased" section at the top
         - Versions in reverse-chronological order
         - Changes grouped by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
         - **Preserve all previous release sections when updating [Unreleased].**

      2. **Integration with version bumping**:
         - After running `bump-version`, update CHANGELOG.md
         - Move changes from "Unreleased" to a new version section
         - Include the version number and release date

      3. **Workflow**:
         - For each PR merged to main, add a bullet point to "Unreleased"
         - Before releasing, review and organize "Unreleased" changes
         - When releasing, move "Unreleased" to new version section
         - Keep entries concise and user-focused

      4. **Change types**:
         - Added: New features
         - Changed: Changes in existing functionality
         - Deprecated: Soon-to-be removed features
         - Removed: Now removed features
         - Fixed: Bug fixes
         - Security: Security fixes

      5. **Integration with feature worktrees**:
         - Update CHANGELOG.md as part of initial feature PR creation
         - Update again with final changes before marking PR as ready
         - See feature-worktrees rule for detailed workflow

      6. **Editing Guidance**:
         - Always insert new items under the [Unreleased] section, immediately after its header and any existing content in that section.
         - Do **not** modify or remove any previous release sections (e.g., [0.3.2], [0.3.1], etc.).
         - If the [Unreleased] section does not exist, create it at the top of the file, above all versioned sections.
         - Never overwrite or truncate the changelog; always preserve the full history.

      7. **CRITICAL: Anti-Truncation Guidelines for AI Agents**:
         - **NEVER replace the entire CHANGELOG.md file content** - only insert new content at the appropriate location
         - **ALWAYS preserve all existing version entries** - the changelog should only grow, never shrink
         - **Use targeted edits** that insert new content without removing existing content
         - **When adding to [Unreleased], only modify lines between the [Unreleased] header and the next version header**
         - **Read the full file first** to understand the complete structure before making any changes
         - **If you see fewer than 5-10 version entries**, stop and verify the file hasn't been truncated before proceeding

  - type: reject
    conditions:
      # Ensure version bump includes CHANGELOG update
      - pattern: "bump-version|bump_version\\.py"
        message: |
          Remember to update CHANGELOG.md after bumping the version.
          Move "Unreleased" changes to a new version section with the bumped version number and today's date.

      # Reject commits without changelog updates for user-facing changes
      - pattern: "(?i)\\b(feat|fix)(?:[:(]|\\b)"
        message: |
          Feature or fix changes should be documented in CHANGELOG.md.
          Add a bullet point to the "Unreleased" section.

      # Reject feature PRs without changelog updates
      - pattern: "(?i)\\b(pr|pull request).*(?:feature|feat).*(?:create|ready|review)"
        message: |
          Feature PRs must include CHANGELOG.md updates.
          1. Add planned changes to the "Unreleased" section in the initial PR.
          2. Update with final changes before marking as ready for review.
          See feature-worktrees rule for workflow details.

      # Reject feature planning without proper WIP indicators
      - pattern: "(?i)\\b(new|initial|start|begin|sketch|plan|flesh|idea)\\s+.*\\b(feature|demo|example|change)\\b"
        message: |
          When planning new features, always update CHANGELOG.md with:
          1. Add entries to the "Unreleased" section.
          2. Use "Planned:" prefix for each entry.
          3. Add "(WIP)" suffix to indicate work-in-progress status.

          Example:
          ```markdown
          ## [Unreleased]

          ### Added
          - Planned: New bootstrap demo for easy demonstration of capabilities (WIP)
          ```

      # Reject unreleased changelog entries without proper WIP marking
      - pattern: "## \\[Unreleased\\][\\s\\S]*?### Added[\\s\\S]*?- (?!Planned:)[^\\n]*(?<!\\(WIP\\))[\\s\\S]*?##"
        message: |
          Planned features in the Unreleased section must be marked with:
          1. "Planned:" prefix at the beginning of the entry
          2. "(WIP)" suffix at the end of the entry

          Example:
          ```markdown
          ## [Unreleased]

          ### Added
          - Planned: New feature description (WIP)
          ```

      # Reject edits that add unreleased or planned changes to a released section
      - pattern: "^## \\[\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\]"
        message: |
          Do not add planned or unreleased changes to a released version section. Place all new work under the [Unreleased] section.

      # Detect potential truncation - file should have many version entries
      - pattern: "(?s)## \\[Unreleased\\].*?## \\[\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\].*?## \\[\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\].*?$"
        message: |
          WARNING: CHANGELOG.md appears to have been truncated!

          The file should contain the complete project history with many version entries.
          If you see only a few versions (especially missing versions like 0.6.2, 0.6.1, 0.6.0, 0.5.x, etc.),
          the file has been truncated and needs to be restored from git history.

          **STOP and reconstruct the full changelog before making any changes.**

criteria:
  required:
    - CHANGELOG.md exists in project root
    - "Unreleased" section at the top
    - Versions in descending order (newest first)
    - Changes grouped by type
    - Each version has a release date
    - Changes focus on user impact, not implementation details
    - Each PR to main updates CHANGELOG.md as needed
    - Integration with version bumping process
    - Coordination with feature worktree development workflow
    - **All previous release sections must be preserved when updating [Unreleased].**
    - **New entries must be inserted after the [Unreleased] header and before any subsequent version headers.**
    - **Planned features must be prefixed with "Planned:" and suffixed with "(WIP)"**
    - **Complete version history preserved (never truncated)**
    - **Targeted edits that preserve existing content**

examples:
  - input: "How should I update the changelog after merging a PR?"
    output: |
      **IMPORTANT**: First read the entire CHANGELOG.md to verify it hasn't been truncated.
      The file should contain many version entries going back to 0.2.x versions.

      If the changelog looks complete, update it as follows:

      1. Add a bullet point to the "Unreleased" section:
      ```markdown
      ## [Unreleased]

      ### Added
      - New feature description

      ### Fixed
      - Bug fix description
      ```

      2. Group by appropriate change type (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
      3. Focus on user impact, not implementation details
      4. Commit with a message like "docs: update changelog for PR #123"

  - input: "Add a planned feature entry"
    output: |
      **FIRST**: Verify the CHANGELOG.md contains the complete history (should have entries back to 0.2.x).

      If complete, add:

      ## [Unreleased]

      ### Added
      - Planned: Add basic logging features to vibectl for improved observability and debugging (WIP)

      ## [0.3.2] - 2025-04-15
      ... (existing content preserved) ...

  - input: "The CHANGELOG.md seems short, what should I do?"
    output: |
      **STOP**: The CHANGELOG.md has been truncated and needs reconstruction.

      1. Check git history: `git log --oneline --grep="bump version"`
      2. Restore missing entries from historical commits
      3. The changelog should contain versions going back to at least 0.2.2
      4. Common missing versions: 0.6.2, 0.6.1, 0.6.0, 0.5.x, 0.4.x, 0.3.x, 0.2.x
      5. Use targeted edits to insert missing content, never replace the entire file
