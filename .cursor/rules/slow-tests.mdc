# Slow Tests Detection and Resolution

Keep tests fast, document when slow.

        message: |
          Test appears to be slow (>1s) without documentation.
          Add a docstring explaining why this test needs to be slow,
          or mock external calls to speed it up.

    message: |
      For slow tests (>1s):
      1. Document reason: """Slow test: Integration test requiring database setup..."""
      2. Check: unmocked external calls, database operations, file I/O
      3. Fix by: mocking dependencies, using in-memory DBs, caching setup
      4. When necessary: add @pytest.mark.slow, document reason

examples:
  - input: |
      # Good: Documented slow test
      @pytest.mark.slow
