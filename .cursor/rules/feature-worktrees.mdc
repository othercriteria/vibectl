      For feature development:
      1. **IMPORTANT**: Start directly with creating a worktree for the new feature to avoid conflicts:
         ```
         # First ensure you're on main and it's up to date
         git checkout main
         git pull

         # Create worktrees directory if it doesn't exist
         mkdir -p ../worktrees/

         # Get project name from the current directory
         PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))

         # Add worktree with project and feature name to avoid conflicts
         # This creates both the branch and the worktree in one step, avoiding branch conflicts
         git worktree add -b feature/name-of-feature ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name main

         # Switch to the worktree directory
         cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name

         # Verify you're in the correct branch
         git status
         ```

      2. Set up development environment in the worktree:
         ```
         # Allow direnv in the worktree
         direnv allow

         # Install pre-commit hooks in the worktree using Makefile target
         nix develop --quiet -c make install-pre-commit 2>/dev/null
         ```

      3. **IDE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS**:
         - For Cursor/VS Code: Open a new window pointed directly at the worktree
           ```
           # From the terminal in your worktree directory
           cursor .   # For Cursor
           code .     # For VS Code
           ```
         - **IMPORTANT**: Some IDEs (including Cursor) may have limitations editing files outside the main workspace
         - If you encounter issues, always maintain separate IDE windows for main workspace and worktree
         - Never try to edit worktree files from your main workspace IDE window
         - Keep a terminal open and use command-line tools when needed for cross-worktree operations

      4. Create a minimal PR for visibility early in development:
         ```
         # IMPORTANT: Do this ONLY in a terminal or IDE window that's in the worktree directory
         # Check current directory to be sure you're in the worktree
         pwd
         git status  # Should show your feature branch

         # Make initial commit with planned changes
         touch PLANNED_CHANGES.md
         echo "# Planned Changes

- Feature 1
- Feature 2" > PLANNED_CHANGES.md

         # Update CHANGELOG.md with planned changes under [Unreleased]
         # First, check the current changelog content to see where to add entries
         grep -A 10 "## \[Unreleased\]" CHANGELOG.md

         # Open the CHANGELOG.md file to add entries under [Unreleased]
         # Add entries in the appropriate section (Added, Changed, Fixed)
         # Example:
         # ## [Unreleased]
         #
         # ### Added
         # - New feature description
         ${EDITOR:-vi} CHANGELOG.md

         # Stage both files
         git add PLANNED_CHANGES.md CHANGELOG.md

         git commit -m "feat: initial commit for feature-name"
         git push -u origin feature/name-of-feature

         # Create the PR using GitHub CLI in the dev shell - suppress Nix output
         nix develop --quiet -c gh pr create --title "WIP: feature-name" --body "Work in progress" --draft 2>/dev/null
         ```

      5. Always do your work in the worktree directory, not the main workspace:
         ```
         # Check which branch you're on before starting work
         git status

         # If you're not in the worktree, switch to it
         cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name
         ```

      6. When complete, commit final changes from the worktree:
         ```
         # Update CHANGELOG.md with final changes under [Unreleased]
         # Make sure all your feature changes are properly documented
         ${EDITOR:-vi} CHANGELOG.md

         # Run pre-commit checks before committing
         nix develop --quiet -c make lint 2>/dev/null

         # Make necessary fixes and commit
         git add .
         git commit -m "feat: implement feature-name"
         git push

         # Update PR from draft to ready for review - suppress Nix output
         nix develop --quiet -c gh pr ready 2>/dev/null
         ```

      7. Before merging, ensure the changelog is up-to-date:
         ```
         # Check if CHANGELOG.md is updated correctly
         git diff HEAD~ CHANGELOG.md

         # If not updated or needs improvements, make changes
         ${EDITOR:-vi} CHANGELOG.md

         # Commit any additional changes
         git add CHANGELOG.md
         git commit -m "docs: update changelog for feature-name"
         git push
         ```

      8. Clean up after PR merge completion:
         ```
         # First, get back to main and pull latest changes
         cd ~/workspace/${PROJECT_NAME}
         git checkout main
         git pull

         # Remove the worktree
         git worktree remove ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name

         # Delete the local branch
         git branch -D feature/name-of-feature 2>/dev/null || true

         # Delete the remote branch (once PR is merged and you're done with it)
         git push origin --delete feature/name-of-feature

         # Clean up references
         git fetch --prune
         ```

      ## Troubleshooting IDE Issues with Worktrees

      ### Problem: Cannot edit worktree files from main workspace IDE
      **Solution**: Open a new IDE window directly in the worktree directory
      ```
      cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name
      cursor .  # or code . for VS Code
      ```

      ### Problem: Files were created/changed in main workspace instead of worktree
      **Solution**:
      ```
      # If no commits were made yet:
      # 1. Copy the files you changed
      # 2. Switch to the worktree
      cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name
      # 3. Create/paste the files there
      # 4. Discard changes in main workspace
      cd ~/workspace/${PROJECT_NAME}
      git checkout .
      ```

      ### Problem: You accidentally committed changes in main workspace
      **Solution**:
      ```
      # 1. Create a patch from the changes
      cd ~/workspace/${PROJECT_NAME}
      git format-patch HEAD~1

      # 2. Move patch to worktree and apply
      mv 0001-*.patch ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name/
      cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name
      git am 0001-*.patch

      # 3. Reset main workspace
      cd ~/workspace/${PROJECT_NAME}
      git reset --hard HEAD~1
      ```

      ### Problem: You created a feature branch in the main workspace and need to move to worktree
      **Solution**:
      ```
      # 1. First check if you have a feature branch already in main workspace
      cd ~/workspace/${PROJECT_NAME}
      git branch | grep feature

      # 2. If you have a feature branch and need to use it with worktree
      # First check if there are any uncommitted changes
      git status

      # 3. Create worktree from existing branch without checked out changes
      PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))
      git branch -f feature/name-of-feature main   # Reset branch to main if needed
      git worktree add ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name feature/name-of-feature

      # 4. Switch to the worktree and continue work there
      cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-feature-name
      git status
      ```

criteria:
  required:
    - Create feature branches with descriptive names (feature/name-of-feature)
    - Use worktrees with project-prefixed directories to avoid collisions
    - Create branch and worktree in one step with `git worktree add -b feature/name-of-feature`
    - ALWAYS switch to the worktree BEFORE creating or editing any files
    - For IDE usage, open a new window directly in the worktree directory
    - Never attempt to edit worktree files from main workspace IDE window
    - Run direnv allow in the worktree
    - Install and run pre-commit hooks in the worktree using Makefile targets
    - Create minimal PR at beginning of feature work
    - Update CHANGELOG.md with planned changes at PR creation
    - Update CHANGELOG.md with final changes before PR is ready for review
    - Work exclusively in the worktree directory, not the main workspace
    - Run pre-commit checks before committing
    - Keep feature branches focused on single features
    - Clean up worktrees after feature completion
    - Delete both local and remote branches after PR merge
    - Suppress Nix output verbosity with --quiet and redirect stderr to /dev/null

      ```

  - input: "How do I use Cursor with worktrees?"
    output: |
      When using Cursor with worktrees:

      1. **IMPORTANT**: Cursor has limitations editing files outside its main workspace. Follow these steps:

      ```
      # First, navigate to your worktree in the terminal
      cd ../worktrees/vibectl-my-feature

      # Then open a new Cursor window directly in the worktree
      cursor .
      ```

      2. **Keep separate Cursor windows**:
         - One for your main workspace
         - Another for your worktree

      3. **Never try to edit worktree files from your main workspace Cursor window**

      4. If you accidentally make changes in main instead of worktree:
      ```
      # If no commits yet:
      # 1. Copy the files you changed
      # 2. Switch to worktree and paste them
      cd ../worktrees/vibectl-my-feature
      # 3. Discard changes in main
      cd ~/workspace/vibectl
      git checkout .

      # If already committed:
      # 1. Create a patch
      cd ~/workspace/vibectl
      git format-patch HEAD~1
      # 2. Apply in worktree
      mv 0001-*.patch ../worktrees/vibectl-my-feature/
      cd ../worktrees/vibectl-my-feature
      git am 0001-*.patch
      # 3. Reset main
      cd ~/workspace/vibectl
      git reset --hard HEAD~1
      ```

  - input: "How do I deal with branch conflicts between main workspace and worktree?"
    output: |
      To avoid branch conflicts between main workspace and worktree:

      1. **Create branch and worktree in one step** (preferred approach):
      ```
      # Start from main
      git checkout main
      git pull

      # Create branch and worktree in one command
      PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))
      git worktree add -b feature/my-feature ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-my-feature main

      # Switch to the worktree
      cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-my-feature
      git status
      ```

      2. If you already created a branch in main workspace:
      ```
      # Check if there are any changes
      git status

      # If needed, reset the branch to main
      git branch -f feature/my-feature main

      # Create worktree using existing branch
      PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))
      git worktree add ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-my-feature feature/my-feature

      # Switch to worktree
      cd ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-my-feature
      git status
      ```

      3. When cleaning up, handle branch deletion carefully:
      ```
      # Clean up worktree
      cd ~/workspace/vibectl
      git worktree remove ../worktrees/${PROJECT_NAME}-my-feature

      # Delete local branch (with force if needed)
      git branch -D feature/my-feature 2>/dev/null || true

      # Delete remote branch
      git push origin --delete feature/my-feature
      ```
