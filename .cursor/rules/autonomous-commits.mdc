          Disabling pre-commit hooks is not allowed. These hooks ensure code quality and consistency.
          If you're encountering issues with pre-commit hooks:
          1. Fix the issues reported by the hooks
          2. If the fixes are non-trivial or unclear, ask the user for guidance
          3. NEVER bypass the hooks by disabling them

criteria:
  required:
    - All tests pass (both unit and integration if applicable)
    - Pre-commit checks pass (NEVER disable or bypass these)
    - Changes are logically complete
    - Documentation is updated if needed
    - No debug/temporary code remains
    - All linting and formatting issues are resolved
  optional:
    - Minor formatting or style fixes can be bundled with functional changes
    - Small related improvements can be included
