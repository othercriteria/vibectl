      ## Autonomous Commit Guidelines

      Always run `git add` to stage all intended changes before committing.
      Pre-commit hooks will run tests and lint checks; commits will be blocked if these fail, unless bypassed with `--no-verify` (not recommended for main).

      Your changes will be committed with these checks:

      1. **Documentation**:
         - STRUCTURE.md updated for structural changes
         - CHANGELOG.md updated for user-facing changes
         - All rule files (.mdc) tracked in git

      2. **Code Quality**:
         - All tests passing
         - Test coverage meeting requirements (or documented exclusions)
         - All linting issues resolved
         - No debug code

      3. **Message Format**:
         - Following conventional commit format (see commit-message rule)
         - Descriptive first line under 72 characters
         - Imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

      Changes on feature branches should follow the feature-worktrees workflow.

criteria:
  required:
    - All tests pass
    - Pre-commit checks pass
    - Documentation updated if needed
    - STRUCTURE.md up-to-date with structural changes
    - CHANGELOG.md up-to-date with feature changes
    - All .mdc files tracked in git
    - No debug code remains
    - All linting issues resolved
    - Test coverage meets target (100%) or exclusions documented
    - No undocumented "pragma: no cover" directives
    - Commit message follows conventional format
