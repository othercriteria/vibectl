## Technical Architecture

### Certificate Hierarchy (IMPLEMENTED âœ…)
```
Root CA (self-signed, 10-year)
â””â”€â”€ Intermediate CA (signed by Root, 5-year)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Server Certificates (signed by Intermediate, 90-day)
    â””â”€â”€ Client Certificates (optional, for mTLS)
```

### Init Container Architecture (IMPLEMENTED âœ…)
```
Init Containers:
â”œâ”€â”€ ca-init: Generate CA and server certificates
â”œâ”€â”€ jwt-init: Generate JWT tokens
â””â”€â”€ demo-extractor (job): Export credentials to ConfigMaps

Main Container:
â””â”€â”€ vibectl-server: Uses certificates from shared volumes
```

### URL Schemes (TO BE ENHANCED)
- `vibectl-server://token@host:port` - Production TLS with system trust store
- `vibectl-server://token@host:port?ca-bundle=/path/to/ca.pem` - Custom CA bundle
- `vibectl-server-insecure://token@host:port` - No TLS (dev only)

### Deployment Models
1. **Public Cloud**: Use cloud provider certificate services (ACM, Google Certificates)
