# Planned Port-Forward and Blocking Functions Implementation

## New Commands

### `port-forward` Command

- Implement `vibectl port-forward` command to forward Kubernetes service ports to local system
- Add rich progress display showing:
  - Connection status with animated indicators
  - Elapsed time since forwarding began
  - Source and destination ports with service details
  - Amount of data transferred in both directions
  - Current active connections
  - Visual indication of traffic activity in real-time

### `wait` Command

- Implement `vibectl wait` command for waiting on specific conditions in Kubernetes
- Add rich progress display showing:
  - Animated waiting indicator
  - Elapsed time since waiting began
  - Current condition being waited for
  - Status updates as checks are performed
  - Visual indication of progress when available

## Enhanced Functionality

### Port-Forward Enhancements

- Implement a proxy layer between kubectl port-forward and local connections to:
  - Monitor and log all traffic passing through the forwarded connection
  - Classify traffic patterns for inclusion in vibe output
  - Detect and report connection issues or errors
  - Provide statistics on connection usage over time
  - Allow traffic manipulation or inspection on demand

- Add convenience options beyond standard kubectl:
  - Support for forwarding multiple ports in a single command
  - Automatic service discovery based on app labels
  - Automatic selection of available local ports
  - Integration with memory to remember commonly used forwards
  - Background mode with daemon capabilities

### Wait Enhancements

- Add support for complex waiting conditions beyond standard kubectl capabilities:
  - Custom resource state transitions
  - Multi-resource dependencies
  - Integration with logs to provide context during waiting
  - Detailed progress tracking with percentage when possible
  - Customizable timeout handling with graceful termination

## Observability and Debugging

- Capture metrics during port-forward sessions:
  - Response times
  - Connection latency
  - Data transfer rates
  - Error patterns
  - Connection attempts

- Provide enhanced debugging for port-forwarding:
  - Connection lifecycle visualization
  - Protocol-aware traffic summaries
  - Detection of common issues (timeouts, connection resets)
  - Correlation with pod events and container status

- Integrate all captured information into the vibe output to provide context about:
  - Service performance characteristics
  - Potential issues detected
  - Usage patterns
  - Suggestions for troubleshooting or optimization

## Implementation Approach

- Use Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O to handle multiple connections
- Leverage `rich` library for terminal UI with progress bars and live displays
- Create dedicated progress visualizations for blocking operations
- Implement clean signal handling for graceful termination
- Design for testability with proper abstraction of system calls
- Ensure backward compatibility with kubectl arguments
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples
