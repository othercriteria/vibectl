# Planned Changes for feature/tls-proxy-support

## Status
**Phase 1 Complete âœ…** - Production-grade TLS infrastructure with CA management and init container architecture is fully implemented and working.

End-to-end demo successfully demonstrates:
- Private CA generation and certificate management
- Init container architecture with zero host filesystem modifications
- Secure TLS connections with proper certificate verification
- JWT authentication and proxy configuration

## Remaining Work

### Phase 2: Public CA Integration (Est. 6 hours)

#### Let's Encrypt Integration
- [ ] ACME client integration for automatic certificate provisioning
- [ ] DNS-01 and HTTP-01 challenge support
- [ ] Certificate renewal automation
- [ ] Support for other ACME-compatible CAs

### Phase 3: Production Integration & Documentation (Est. 10 hours)

#### cert-manager Integration Examples
- [ ] ClusterIssuer configuration for Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Certificate CRD for automatic certificate management
- [ ] Integration with ingress controllers
- [ ] Certificate monitoring and alerting

#### Security Hardening
- [ ] Modern TLS protocol support (TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.3 preferred)
- [ ] Strong cipher suite configuration
- [ ] Certificate transparency monitoring
- [ ] HSTS header support

#### Production Deployment Guide
- [ ] Step-by-step production setup with cert-manager
- [ ] Public CA vs. private CA decision tree
- [ ] Security best practices and hardening guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for certificate issues

#### Cloud Provider Examples
- [ ] AWS EKS with ALB and ACM certificates
- [ ] GKE with Google-managed certificates
- [ ] Azure AKS with Key Vault certificates
- [ ] On-premises deployment with private CA

## Implementation Priority

**Next Steps:**
1. **Let's Encrypt Integration** - Enable automatic public CA certificates
2. **Client Trust Store Management** - Support custom CA bundles
3. **cert-manager Examples** - Production Kubernetes patterns
4. **Complete Documentation** - Production deployment guides

## Success Criteria (Remaining)
- [ ] Production deployments can use public CA certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Private CA deployments work with custom trust stores
- [ ] Certificate renewal happens automatically without service interruption
- [ ] cert-manager integration provides seamless K8s certificate management
- [ ] Documentation covers all major deployment scenarios
- [ ] Security scanning shows no TLS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (< 5% overhead)

## Current Architecture (Implemented)

The following foundational components are complete and working:

- **Private CA Infrastructure**: Root/Intermediate CA hierarchy with full lifecycle management
- **Init Container Architecture**: Kubernetes-native certificate generation with container isolation
- **TLS Integration**: Complete server and client TLS with proper certificate verification
- **CLI Management**: Full `vibectl-server ca` command suite for certificate operations
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 34 CA tests + full TLS coverage
- **Demo Environment**: End-to-end working demo with proper TLS verification
