- **ACME Client**: Complete ACME protocol implementation
- **ACME Server Integration**: Full serve-acme mode with TLS-ALPN-01 challenge support

## ACME Integration Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### ACME Server Integration Summary
Successfully integrated ACME client with `vibectl-server serve-acme` mode:

#### Features Implemented ✅
- **Server Integration**: ACME client fully integrated with serve-acme command
- **Certificate Provisioning**: Automatic certificate provisioning on server startup
- **Challenge Support**: TLS-ALPN-01 challenge working with LoadBalancer services
- **Configuration Options**: Email, domain, directory URL, and challenge directory configuration
- **Pebble Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Pebble ACME test server
- **Certificate Chain Handling**: Proper intermediate CA extraction for client verification
- **Demo Infrastructure**: Complete demo with MetalLB, nip.io domains, and automated setup

#### Technical Implementation
- **File**: Enhanced `vibectl/server/main.py` with serve-acme integration
- **Demo**: `examples/manifests/vibectl-server/demo-acme.sh` - full end-to-end demo
- **Kubernetes**: Complete manifests for ACME deployment with LoadBalancer services
- **Certificate Management**: Automatic certificate chain extraction and client CA bundle setup

✅ **Certificate provisioning**: Automatic certificate generation and storage
✅ **Client verification**: Proper CA bundle extraction and TLS verification
✅ **JWT authentication**: Secure token-based authentication working with ACME certificates

## TLS 1.3+ Hardening Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### Security Enhancement Summary
Successfully implemented TLS 1.3+ enforcement while maintaining ACME compatibility:

#### Features Implemented ✅
- **Runtime TLS Version Enforcement**: gRPC (h2) connections require TLS 1.3, ACME (acme-tls/1) allows TLS 1.2+
- **ALPN Multiplexer Hardening**: Selective TLS version enforcement based on negotiated ALPN protocol
- **ACME Compatibility**: TLS-ALPN-01 challenge validation works with TLS 1.2 clients (Pebble, Let's Encrypt)
- **Client Hardening**: gRPC proxy clients enforce TLS 1.3+ for all connections
- **Comprehensive Testing**: New test suite validates TLS version enforcement behavior

#### Technical Implementation
- **Files**: Enhanced `vibectl/server/alpn_multiplexer.py` and `vibectl/proxy_model_adapter.py`
- **Tests**: `tests/server/test_alpn_tls_version_enforcement.py` - dedicated TLS enforcement tests
- **Security**: Runtime rejection of gRPC connections using TLS < 1.3 while allowing ACME validation
- **Compatibility**: ACME validation clients can use TLS 1.2 per RFC 8737 requirements

#### Validation Results
✅ **gRPC TLS 1.3 enforcement**: All gRPC proxy connections require TLS 1.3
✅ **ACME TLS 1.2 compatibility**: TLS-ALPN-01 validation works with TLS 1.2 clients
✅ **Runtime enforcement**: Protocol-specific TLS version requirements enforced at connection time
✅ **Test coverage**: Comprehensive test suite validates enforcement behavior
✅ **Production ready**: End-to-end ACME demo works with hardened TLS configuration

## ACME Client Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Summary
- **File**: `vibectl/server/acme_client.py` (162 statements, 437 lines)
- **Test Suite**: 37 comprehensive tests in `tests/test_acme_client.py`
- **Key Features**: Account registration, HTTP-01/DNS-01 challenges, certificate request/renewal

### ACME Functionality Implemented
- ✅ **Account Management**: Registration with ACME server, handles existing accounts
- ✅ **Challenge Support**: HTTP-01 (automated) and DNS-01 (manual) challenge types
- ✅ **Certificate Lifecycle**: Request, validation, issuance, and renewal checking
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions `ACMECertificateError` and `ACMEValidationError`
- ✅ **CSR Generation**: Certificate Signing Request creation for single/multiple domains
- ✅ **Certificate Management**: Expiry checking and renewal logic

### Test Coverage Details
- **Error scenarios**: ACME errors, validation failures, timeouts, file operations
- **Challenge validation**: Both HTTP-01 and DNS-01 challenge flows
- **Certificate management**: Expiry checking, renewal decisions
- **Edge cases**: Unsupported challenges, cleanup errors, authorization failures

## Security Audit Findings
- TLS and JWT-based authentication are implemented and generally follow best practices.
- The server generates self-signed certificates and a JWT secret if none are provided. Persist these secrets to avoid accidental rotation and invalidating existing tokens.
- Authentication uses HS256 tokens with no revocation mechanism. Consider supporting asymmetric signing (RS256/ES256) and token revocation/rotation policies.
- Clients embed tokens in the proxy URL which may leak via shell history or logs. Document secure handling and encourage environment variables or files.
- Insecure mode (`vibectl-server-insecure://`) should only be used for local testing. Add clear warnings in docs and CLI output.
- Ensure CA bundles are distributed out‑of‑band through a trusted channel so clients can verify the server certificate.
- Future hardening should enforce TLS 1.2+, strong cipher suites and optionally support mTLS for environments that require it.
- Operators can build trust by publishing CA fingerprints and demonstrating certificate status via `vibectl-server ca status` or `openssl verify` against the distributed bundle.
