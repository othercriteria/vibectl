# Planned Changes for Scale and Rollout Commands

## New Commands to Implement

### Scale Command
- Implement `vibectl scale` to scale Kubernetes resources
- Support scaling deployments, statefulsets, and replicasets
- Implement natural language scaling with `vibectl scale vibe`
- Add informative LLM summaries of scaling operations
- Support standard kubectl scale flags

### Rollout Command
- Implement `vibectl rollout` command group
- Support common rollout subcommands:
  - `status` - Check rollout status
  - `history` - View rollout history
  - `undo` - Rollback to previous version
  - `restart` - Restart pods in a deployment
  - `pause/resume` - Control rollout process
- Include vibe-based interaction for all rollout operations
- Add LLM summaries for rollout status and history

## Implementation Plan
1. Research kubectl scale and rollout command behaviors
2. Create CLI command structure for both commands
3. Add appropriate prompt templates
4. Implement command handlers with kubectl integration
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation
