# Planned Changes for feature/tls-proxy-support

(See `docs/llm-proxy-server.md` for additional context.)

## Status
**Phases 1-4 Complete âœ…** - Full TLS infrastructure with CA management, CLI refactoring, ACME client/server integration, and TLS 1.3+ hardening are all implemented and working.

## Remaining Work

### Phase 5: Production Integration & Documentation (Est. 8 hours)

#### cert-manager Integration Examples
- [ ] ClusterIssuer configuration for Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Certificate CRD for automatic certificate management
- [ ] Integration with ingress controllers
- [ ] Certificate monitoring and alerting

#### Security Hardening
- [x] **Modern TLS protocol support** - TLS 1.3 enforced for gRPC, TLS 1.2+ for ACME compatibility
- [ ] Strong cipher suite configuration
- [ ] Certificate transparency monitoring
- [ ] HSTS header support

#### Production Deployment Guide
- [ ] Step-by-step production setup with cert-manager
- [ ] Public CA vs. private CA decision tree
- [ ] Security best practices and hardening guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for certificate issues

#### Additional Production Tasks
- Moved cloud provider examples and certificate renewal enhancements to [TODO-SERVER.md](TODO-SERVER.md)

#### Testing and Validation
- [x] **HTTP-01 Challenge Demo** - Created `demo-acme-http.sh` for end-to-end testing of HTTP-01 challenge flow
- [x] **Updated Demo Selector** - Added HTTP-01 option to main `demo.sh` selector with proper cleanup support
- [ ] **HTTP-01 Challenge Bug Fix** - CRITICAL: Discovered race condition in HTTP-01 challenge implementation where challenge tokens are cleaned up immediately after creation, before ACME validation can occur. This prevents HTTP-01 challenges from working.

## Implementation Priority

**Next Steps:**
1. **cert-manager Examples** - Production Kubernetes patterns
2. **Complete Documentation** - Production deployment guides
3. **Additional server enhancements** - See [TODO-SERVER.md](TODO-SERVER.md) for certificate renewal automation and cloud provider examples

## Success Criteria (Remaining)
- [ ] **HTTP-01 challenge race condition fixed** - Challenge tokens must remain available during ACME validation
- [ ] cert-manager integration provides seamless K8s certificate management
- [ ] Documentation covers all major deployment scenarios
- [ ] Security scanning shows no TLS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (< 5% overhead)
- Additional server-specific criteria moved to [TODO-SERVER.md](TODO-SERVER.md)

## Completed Architecture

**Foundation Complete:**
- Private CA Infrastructure with full lifecycle management
- Init Container Architecture for Kubernetes-native certificate generation
- Complete TLS integration with proper certificate verification
- CLI Management with `vibectl-server ca` command suite and specialized serve modes
- ACME Client with comprehensive protocol implementation and testing
- ACME Server Integration with TLS-ALPN-01 challenge support
- TLS 1.3+ Hardening with protocol-specific enforcement (gRPC requires 1.3+, ACME supports 1.2+)

## Security Considerations for Production

Key areas to address in production deployment:
- JWT tokens use HS256 with no revocation mechanism - consider asymmetric signing and rotation policies
- CA bundles should be distributed through trusted channels for client verification
- Document secure token handling to prevent leakage in shell history/logs
- Implement strong cipher suite configuration and certificate transparency monitoring
- Add HSTS header support for web interfaces
