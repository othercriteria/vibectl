# Planned Port-Forward and Blocking Functions Implementation

## New Commands

### `port-forward` Command

- ✅ Implement `vibectl port-forward` command to forward Kubernetes service ports to local system
- ✅ Add rich progress display showing:
  - ✅ Connection status with animated indicators
  - ✅ Elapsed time since forwarding began
  - ✅ Source and destination ports with service details
  - Amount of data transferred in both directions
  - Current active connections
  - Visual indication of traffic activity in real-time

### `wait` Command

- ✅ Implement `vibectl wait` command for waiting on specific conditions in Kubernetes
- ✅ Support for basic condition checks using standard kubectl functionality
- ✅ Support for vibe-based natural language requests

## Implementation Approach

- ✅ Use Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O to handle multiple connections
- ✅ Used in `wait` command implementation as a foundation for later port-forward development
- ✅ Leverage `rich` library for terminal UI with progress bars and live displays
- ✅ Create dedicated progress visualizations for blocking operations
- ✅ Implement clean signal handling for graceful termination
- ✅ Design for testability with proper abstraction of system calls
- ✅ Ensure backward compatibility with kubectl arguments
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples
