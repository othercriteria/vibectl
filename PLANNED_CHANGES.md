# Completed Changes – uv-based dependency locking

All planned changes have been implemented:

- ✅ Add uv to development dependencies (pyproject.toml `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`)
- ✅ Generate and commit `uv.lock` using `uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra=dev --output-file=uv.lock`
- ✅ Update `flake.nix` devShell to include `pkgs.uv`
- ✅ Add `lock` target to Makefile to regenerate the lock file
- ✅ Document workflow in STRUCTURE.md / TESTING.md

## Summary

The project now uses uv for fast, deterministic dependency resolution and locking:

- **uv** is included in development dependencies and Nix environment
- **uv.lock** provides locked dependency versions (committed to version control)
- **make lock** command regenerates the lock file when dependencies change
- **Documentation** added to both STRUCTURE.md and TESTING.md explaining the workflow

This ensures reproducible builds across different environments and faster dependency resolution.
