# Planned Changes: Basic Logging Features for vibectl

## Goals
- Add basic logging to vibectl to improve observability and debugging.
- Ensure logs are structured and configurable (level, output).
- Integrate logging with existing CLI commands and error handling.

## Tasks
- [ ] Decide on logging library (likely Python standard logging)
- [ ] Add logger initialization to main entry point
- [ ] Add logging to key operations (start, stop, errors, etc.)
- [ ] Make log level configurable via CLI flag or environment variable
- [ ] Add tests to verify logging output and error reporting
- [ ] Update documentation to describe logging usage

## Considerations
- Keep logging simple and non-intrusive for users
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Ensure logging does not break existing CLI output
- Plan for future extensibility (e.g., file logging, JSON logs)
