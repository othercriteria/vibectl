- Update `handle_command_output` in `vibectl/command_handler.py` to consume streamed Vibe results.
  - Modify `_process_vibe_output` to handle streamed data.
  - Update `console_manager.print_vibe` or add a new method for streaming display.
- Refactor and clean up `model_adapter.py` and `command_handler.py` as opportunities arise.
- Ensure tests are updated or added for streaming functionality.
  - Mock streaming responses in tests.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
